<b>Summary</b>

This project challenged me to learn how to use Javascript and begin to use some of its native functions.

I spent a long time trouble shooting my code's logic trying to figure out why it wouldn't return the string and after many hours it turned out to be just a syntax error of mispelling my variables.  With that out of the way, it does feel like I am progressing.
